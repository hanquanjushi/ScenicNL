Review:
The code uses the correct file path for the map and uses one of the maps listed. It uses proper Scenic syntax. There are no string variables in the code, so we don't need to check for double quotes. The code uses the correct behaviors and parameters for the behaviors. It uses the distribution types that are supported in Scenic, with the correct distribution parameters. The code reflects the natural language description.
